                          <p>The development of this ePortfolio has given me a valuable opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills gained throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University. This ePortfolio functions as a comprehensive showcase of my academic achievements, practical projects, and growth in Computer Science.
                          Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University I've developed the following:

                                  Frontend service, components. Initially, this was my first enhancement, but I thought
                                  of a better idea instead of implementing Kubernetes. The frontend application is the
                                  most important aspect of a service, the issue is that frontends can easily be filled
                                  with too much information, slowing changes and reducing searchability. Iâ€™ve
                                  experienced this issue in my personal development, and as an enhancement, I divided
                                  key aspects of code into their respective components. This artifact showcases features
                                  such as pagination and data handling.

                                  Backend: Filtering and Pagination. Pagination and filtering are critical features in
                                  modern applications, ensuring that data remains accessible even when dealing with
                                  large datasets. This artifact focuses on adding pagination and filtering to a backend
                                  service using NestJS. Pagination is achieved by returning data along with pagination
                                  parameters and a total count, while filters are applied through URL queries, enhancing
                                  data searchability and navigation.

                                  the implementation of pagination and filtering in a NestJS application. By adopting
                                  industry-standard practices for data handling, this solution provides scalability and
                                  efficiency for handling large datasets. The experience of adding these features has

                                  Backend/Admin/Frontend: Violins and User Authentication. This artifact focuses on
                                  implementing user authentication and roles management within a backend application.
                                  Securing routes is essential to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify
                                  specific data. In addition, a "Viola" table was introduced to simplify data
                                  management, and user roles were implemented to restrict access based on privileges.
                                  The goal is to provide secure and role-based access control for backend operations and
                                  frontend interactions.

                                  <strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented a JWT-based authentication system to
                                  securely manage user access. <strong>Roles:</strong> Introduced role-based access
                                  control to restrict routes based on user roles, ensuring only authorized users can
                                  perform specific actions. <strong>Guard Implementation:</strong> Faced challenges in
                                  implementing the roles guard, which required handling roles as a string rather than an
                                  array.

                                  This artifact demonstrates a deep understanding of backend security practices,
                                  particularly the importance of user authentication and role-based access control. By
                                  separating the "Violin" and "Viola" tables and ensuring secure data handling with JWT
                                  tokens and guards, the solution adheres to industry standards for securing
                                  applications. The experience gained from overcoming challenges related to roles and
                                  authentication will help in future projects requiring secure and scalable backend
                                  systems.
